	NOTE: This is a free website template called Variant Rounded, originally 
		designed as an exclusive template through the Style Master CSS 
		editor. Variant Rounded was built by Andreas Viklund, and it is free
		to download and free to use. All I ask for in return is that you keep 
		the credit link in the footer.

		The code in this template is valid XHTML 1.0 Strict. It has basic 
		accessibility features included, and includes basic styles for porting 
		the template into themes for content management systems and blog engines. 
		Please note that this template version does not include any CMS-specific 
		code, it is plain XHTML/CSS and it will not work with any CMS without 
		proper modifications. It will however work well to build static HTML 
		websites from, and you are more than welcome to use it as wanted. To 
		learn more about using templates, visit http://andreasviklund.com!
