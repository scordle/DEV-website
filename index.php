	NOTE: This is a free website template called Variant Rounded, originally 
		designed as an exclusive template through the Style Master CSS 
		editor. Variant Rounded was built by Andreas Viklund, and it is free
		to download and free to use. All I ask for in return is that you keep 
		the credit link in the footer.

		The code in this template is valid XHTML 1.0 Strict. It has basic 
		accessibility features included, and includes basic styles for porting 
		the template into themes for content management systems and blog engines. 
		Please note that this template version does not include any CMS-specific 
		code, it is plain XHTML/CSS and it will not work with any CMS without 
		proper modifications. It will however work well to build static HTML 
		websites from, and you are more than welcome to use it as wanted. To 
		learn more about using templates, visit http://andreasviklund.com!

		<!--<h2>Computer Science Education Week Starts</h2>
		<div class="datetag">
			<span class="date">09</span>

		</div>
		
		<p>Read the <a href="http://goo.gl/SCvJHW">full article</a> </p>
		<p>Computer Science Education Week, which takes place Dec. 9-13 (and of 
		which <a href="http://www.acm.org">ACM</a> is a founding partner), is 
		expected to reach more than 4.5 million students around the world, with 
		more than 37,000 events planned in 167 countries. </p>
		
		<p>The level of participation and the number of activities this year far 
		exceeds previous years. The dramatic increase in participation can be 
		attributed to the <em>Hour of Code</em> initiative from 
		<a href="http:.//www.code.org">Code.org</a>, which aims to ensure that every
		student has the opportunity to learn to code. </p>
		
		<p>Code.org has contributed a set of 20 puzzles designed to teach the basics
		of computer science. The puzzles are based on Blocky, a visual programming 
		language that has blocks users drag and drop to write programs and 
		characters from popular games. CSEdWeek.org says more than 1.3 million 
		people already have learned an hour of code. </p>
		
		<p>Meanwhile, Microsoft Research has developed <a href="http://goo.gl/ZlOmrX">
		TouchDevelop</a>, a tutorial for creating flying monsters
		and crazy drawings on smartphones and other touch-enabled devices. Microsoft
		Research's <a href="http://goo.gl/hvx5KG">Kodu Game Lab</a> also offers Hour
		of Code Kodu Touch Primer, which consists of five one-hour experiences--one 
		for each day of the week.</p>	
		
		<p>Many other tutorials projects are available at 
		<a href="http://goo.gl/dYnvyc">Code.org</a> -->
